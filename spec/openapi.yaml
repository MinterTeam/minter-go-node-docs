    # Introduction


    Minter is a blockchain network that lets people, projects, and companies
    issue and manage their own coins and trade them at a fair market price with
    absolute and instant liquidity.


    # Install Minter


    There are several ways you can install Minter Blockchain Testnet node on
    your machine.


    ## Using binary


    1. **Download Minter**

       Get [latest binary build](https://github.com/MinterTeam/minter-go-node/releases) suitable for your architecture and unpack it to desired folder.

    2. **Run Minter**

       ```bash
       ./minter
       ```

      Then open http://localhost:3000/ in local browser to see node's GUI.

    ## From Source


    You'll need `golang` installed https://golang.org/doc/install and the
    required

    [environment variables
    set](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Setting-GOPATH)


    1. **Clone Minter source code to your machine**

      ```bash
      mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/MinterTeam
      cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/MinterTeam
      git clone https://github.com/MinterTeam/minter-go-node.git
      cd minter-go-node
      ```

    2. **Get Tools & Dependencies**

      ```bash
      make get_tools
      make get_vendor_deps
      ```

    3. **Compile**

      minter
      ```

      Then open `http://localhost:3000/` in local browser to see node's GUI.

    # Blockchain Specification


    **Tendermint**


    Minter Blockchain utilizes `Tendermint Consensus Engine`.


    Tendermint is software for securely and consistently replicating an
    application on many machines.

    By securely, we mean that Tendermint works even if up to 1/3 of machines
    fail in arbitrary ways.

    By consistently, we mean that every non-faulty machine sees the same
    transaction log and computes the same state.

    Secure and consistent replication is a fundamental problem in distributed
    systems; it plays a critical role in the

    fault tolerance of a broad range of applications, from currencies, to
    elections, to infrastructure orchestration,

    and beyond.


    Tendermint is designed to be easy-to-use, simple-to-understand, highly
    performant, and useful for a wide variety of

    distributed applications.


    You can read more about Tendermint Consensus in [official
    documentation](https://tendermint.com/docs/)


    **Consensus**


    In Minter we implemented Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) Consensus Protocol.


    DPOS is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible
    consensus model available. DPOS leverages the power of stakeholder approval
    voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way.


    **Block speed**


    Minter Blockchain is configured to produce `1 block per 5 sec`. Actual block
    speed may vary depends on validators count, their computational power,
    internet speed, etc.


    **Block size**


    We limit block size to `10 000 transactions`. Block size in terms of bytes
    is not limited.


    # Coins


    Minter Blockchain is multi-coin system.


    Base coin in testnet is `MNT`.\

    Base coin in mainnet is `BIP`.


    Smallest part of *each* coin is called `pip`.\

    1 pip = 1^-18 of any coin. In Blockchain and API we only operating with
    pips.


    > **Note:** Each coin has its **own** pip. You should treat pip like atomic
    part of a coin, not as currency:\

    > 1 MNT = 10^18 pip (MNT's pip)\

    > 1 ABC = 10^18 pip (ABC's pip)\

    > 1 MNT != 1 ABC


    ## Coin Issuance


    Every user of Minter can issue own coin. Each coin is backed by base coin in
    some proportion.

    Issue own coin is as simple as filling a form with given fields:


    - **Coin name** - Name of a coin. Arbitrary string up to 64 letters length.

    - **Coin symbol** - Symbol of a coin. Must be unique, alphabetic, uppercase,
    3 to 10 letters length.

    - **Initial supply** - Amount of coins to issue. Issued coins will be
    available to sender account.

    - **Initial reserve** - Initial reserve in base coin.

    - **Constant Reserve Ratio (CRR)** - uint, should be from 10 to 100.


    After coin issued you can send is as ordinary coin using standard wallets.


    ## Issuance Fees


    To issue a coin Coiner should pay fee. Fee is depends on length of Coin
    Symbol.


    3 letters – 1 000 000 bips + standard transaction fee\

    4 letters – 100 000 bips + standard transaction fee\

    5 letters – 10 000 bips + standard transaction fee\

    6 letters – 1000 bips + standard transaction fee\

    7 letters – 100 bips + standard transaction fee\

    8 letters – 10 bips + standard transaction fee\

    9-10 letters - just standard transaction fee


    ## Coin Exchange


    Each coin in system can be instantly exchanged to another coin. This is
    possible because each coin has "reserve" in base

    coin.


    Here are some formulas we are using for coin conversion:


    **CalculatePurchaseReturn**\

    Given a coin supply (s), reserve balance (r), CRR (c) and a deposit amount
    (d), calculates the return for a given conversion (in the base coin):


    ```go

    return s * ((1 + d / r) ^ c - 1);

    ```  



    **CalculateSaleReturn**\

    Given a coin supply (s), reserve balance (r), CRR (c) and a sell amount (a),
    calculates the return for a given conversion


    ```go

    return r * (1 - (1 - a / s) ^ (1 / c));

    ```


    # Transactions


    Transactions in Minter are
    [RLP-encoded](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP) structures.


    Example of a signed transaction:

        f873230101aae98a4d4e540000000000000094a93163fdf10724dc4785ff5cbfb9
        ac0b5949409f880de0b6b3a764000080801ba06838db4a2197cfd70ede8d8d184d
        bf332932ca051a243eb7886791250e545dd3a04b63fb1d1b5ef5f2cbd2ea12530c
        da520b3280dcb75bfd45a873629109f24b29

    Each transaction has:


    -   **Nonce** - int, used for prevent transaction reply.

    -   **Gas Price** - big int, used for managing transaction fees.

    -   **Gas Coin** - 10 bytes, symbol of a coin to pay fee

    -   **Type** - type of transaction (see below).

    -   **Data** - data of transaction (depends on transaction type).

    -   **Payload** (arbitrary bytes) - arbitrary user-defined bytes.

    -   **Service Data** - reserved field.

    -   **Signature Type** - single or multisig transaction.

    -   **Signature Data** - digital signature of transaction.


    ```go

    type Transaction struct {
        Nonce         uint64
        GasPrice      *big.Int
        GasCoin       [10]byte
        Type          byte
        Data          []byte
        Payload       []byte

        SignatureData Signature
    }


    type Signature struct {
        V           *big.Int
        R           *big.Int
        S           *big.Int
    }


    type MultiSignature struct {
        MultisigAddress [20]byte
        Signatures      []Signature
    }

    ```


    ## Signature Types


    |Type Name                           |Byte|

    |----------------------------------- |----|

    |**TypeSingle**                      |0x01|

    |**TypeMulti**                       |0x02|


    ## Types


    Type of transaction is determined by a single byte.


    |Type Name                           |Byte|

    |----------------------------------- |----|

    |**TypeSend**                        |0x01|

    # Minter Check


    Minter Check is like an ordinary bank check. Each user of network can

    issue check with any amount of coins and pass it to another person.

    Receiver will be able to cash a check from arbitrary account.


    ## Introduction


    Checks are prefixed with "Mc". Here is example of a Minter Check:


    ```

    Mcf89b01830f423f8a4d4e5400000000000000843b9aca00b8419b3beac2c6ad88a8bd54d2

    4912754bb820e58345731cb1b9bc0885ee74f9e50a58a80aa990a29c98b05541b266af99d3

    825bb1e5ed4e540c6e2f7c9b40af9ecc011ca0387fd67ec41be0f1cf92c7d0181368b4c67a

    b07df2d2384192520d74ff77ace6a04ba0e7ad7b34c64223fe59584bc464d53fcdc7091faa

    ee5df0451254062cfb37

    ```


    Each Minter Check has:

    -   **Nonce** - unique "id" of the check.

    -   **Coin Symbol** - symbol of coin.

    -   **Value** - amount of coins.

    -   **Due Block** - defines last block height in which the check can
        be used.
    -   **Lock** - secret to prevent hijacking.

    -   **Signature** - signature of issuer.


    ## Check hijacking protection


    Minter Checks are issued offline and do not exist in blockchain before

    "cashing". So we decided to use special passphrase to protect checks

    from hijacking by another person in the moment of activation. Hash of

    this passphrase is used as private key in ECDSA to prove that sender is

    the one who owns the check.


    *TODO: describe algorithm*


    ## How to issue a Minter Check


    For issuing Minter Check you can use our

    [tool](https://testnet.console.minter.network).


    You will need to fill a form:


    :   -   **Nonce** - unique \"id\" of the check.
        -   **Coin Symbol** - symbol of coin.
        -   **Value** - amount of coins.
        -   **Pass phrase** - secret phrase which you will pass to receiver
            of the check.
            
    ## How to cash a Minter Check


    To redeem a check user should have:

    -   Check itself

    -   Secret passphrase


    After redeeming balance of user will increased instantly.


    ## Commission


    There is no commission for issuing a check because it done offline. In

    the moment of cashing issuer will pay commission.


    # Multisignatures


    Minter has built-in support for multisignature wallets. Multisignatures,

    or technically Accountable Subgroup Multisignatures (ASM), are signature

    schemes which enable any subgroup of a set of signers to sign any

    message, and reveal to the verifier exactly who the signers were.


    Suppose the set of signers is of size *n*. If we validate a signature if

    any subgroup of size *k* signs a message, this becomes what is commonly

    reffered to as a *k* of *n* multisig in Bitcoin.


    Minter Multisig Wallets has 2 main goals:

    -   Atomic swaps with sidechains

    -   Basic usage to manage funds within Minter Blockchain


    ## Structure of multisig wallet


    Each multisig wallet has:

    -   Set of signers with corresponding weights

    -   Threshold


    Transactions from multisig wallets are proceed identically to the K of N

    multisig in Bitcoin, except the multisig fails if the sum of the weights

    of signatures is less than the threshold.

    # Commissions


    For each transaction sender should pay fee. Fees are measured in

    "units".


    1 unit = 10^15 pip = 0.001 bip.


    ## Standard commissions


    Here is a list of current fees:

      |Type                             | Fee |
      |---------------------------------| ---------------------|
      |**TypeSend**                     | 10 units |
      |**TypeSellCoin**                 | 100 units |
      |**TypeSellAllCoin**              | 100 units |
      |**TypeBuyCoin**                  | 100 units |
      |**TypeCreateCoin**               | 1000 units |
      |**TypeDeclareCandidacy**         | 10000 units |
      |**TypeDelegate**                 | 100 units |
      |**TypeUnbond**                   | 100 units |
      |**TypeRedeemCheck**              | 30 units |
      |**TypeSetCandidateOnline**       | 100 units |
      |**TypeSetCandidateOffline**      | 100 units |
      |**TypeCreateMultisig**           | 100 units |
      |**TypeMultisend**                | 10+(n-1)*5 units |
      |**TypeEditCandidate**            | 10000 units |

    Also sender should pay extra 2 units per byte in Payload and Service

    # Validators


    ## Introduction


    The Minter Blockchain is based on Tendermint, which relies on a set of

    validators that are responsible for committing new blocks in the

    blockchain. These validators participate in the consensus protocol by

    broadcasting votes which contain cryptographic signatures signed by each

    validator's private key.


    Validator candidates can bond their own coins and have coins

    "delegated", or staked, to them by token holders. The validators are

    determined by who has the most stake delegated to them.


    Validators and their delegators will earn BIP (MNT) as rewards for

    blocks and commissions. Note that validators can set commission on the

    rewards their delegators receive as additional incentive.


    If validators double sign or frequently offline, their staked coins

    (including coins of users that delegated to them) can be slashed. The

    penalty depends on the severity of the violation.


    ## Requirements

    Minimal requirements for running Validator\'s Node in testnet are:


    -   4GB RAM

    -   200GB SSD

    -   x64 2.0 GHz 4 vCPUs


    SSD disks are preferable for high transaction throughput.


    Recommended:


    -   4GB RAM

    -   200GB SSD

    -   x64 3.4 GHz 8 vCPUs

    -   HSM


    ## Validators limitations

    Minter Network has limited number of available slots for validators.


    At genesis there will be just `16` of them. `4` slots will be added each

    `518,400` blocks. Maximum validators count is `256`.


    ## Rewards

    Rewards for blocks and commissions are accumulated and proportionally

    (based on stake value) payed once per `12 blocks` (approx 1 minute) to

    all active validators (and their delegators).


    Block rewards are configured to decrease from 333 to 0 BIP (MNT) in \~7

    years.


    Delegators receive their rewards at the same time after paying

    commission to their validators (commission value is based on

    validator\'s settings).


    `10%` from reward going to DAO account.


    `10%` from reward going to Developers.


    ## Rules and fines


    Validators have one main responsibility:

    -   Be able to constantly run a correct version of the software:
        validators need to make sure that their servers are always online
        and their private keys are not compromised.

    If a validator misbehaves, its bonded stake along with its delegators\'

    stake and will be slashed. The severity of the punishment depends on the

    type of fault. There are 3 main faults that can result in slashing of

    funds for a validator and its delegators:


    -   **Double signing**: If someone reports on chain A that a validator
        signed two blocks at the same height on chain A and chain B, this
        validator will get slashed on chain A
    -   **Unavailability**: If a validator\'s signature has not been
        included in the last 12 blocks, 1% of stake will get slashed and
        validator will be turned off

    Note that even if a validator does not intentionally misbehave, it can

    still be slashed if its node crashes, looses connectivity, gets DDOSed,

    or if its private key is compromised.


    ## Becoming validator in testnet


    1. Install and run Minter Full Node.

    2. Get your validator\'s public key from [Minter
        GUI](http://localhost:3000/).
    3. Go to [Minter
    Console](https://testnet.console.minter.network/masternode/) and send 2
    transactions:
      
      Fill and send `Declare candidacy` and `Set candidate online` forms.

      P.S. You can receive testnet coins in our telegram wallet \@BipWallet\_Bot.

      1. Declare candidacy

          Validators should declare their candidacy, after which users
          can delegate and, if they so wish, unbond. Then declaring
          candidacy validator should fill a form:

          -   Address - You will receive rewards to this address and
              will be able to on/off your validator.
          -   Public Key - Paste public key from step 2 *(Mp\...)*.
          -   Commission - Set commission for delegated stakes.
          -   Coin - Enter coin of your stake (i.e. MNT).
          -   Stake - Enter value of your stake in given coin.

      2. Set candidate online

          Validator is **offline** by default. When offline, validator
          is not included in the list of Minter Blockchain validators,
          so he is not receiving any rewards and cannot be punished
          for low availability.

          To turn your validator **on**, you should provide Public Key
          (from step 2 *(Mp\...)*).

          *Note: You should send transaction from address you choose
          in Address field in step 3.1*

    4. Done.

      Now you will receive reward as long as your node is running and available.

    ## DDOS protection. Sentry node architecture

    Denial-of-service attacks occur when an attacker sends a flood of

    internet traffic to an IP address to prevent the server at the IP

    address from connecting to the internet.


    An attacker scans the network, tries to learn the IP address of various

    validator nodes and disconnect them from communication by flooding them

    with traffic.


    One recommended way to mitigate these risks is for validators to

    carefully structure their network topology in a so-called sentry node

    architecture.


    Validator nodes should only connect to full-nodes they trust because

    they operate them themselves or are run by other validators they know

    socially. A validator node will typically run in a data center. Most

    data centers provide direct links the networks of major cloud providers.

    The validator can use those links to connect to sentry nodes in the

    cloud. This shifts the burden of denial-of-service from the validator\'s

    node directly to its sentry nodes, and may require new sentry nodes be

    spun up or activated to mitigate attacks on existing ones.


    Sentry nodes can be quickly spun up or change their IP addresses.

    Because the links to the sentry nodes are in private IP space, an

    internet based attacked cannot disturb them directly. This will ensure

    validator block proposals and votes always make it to the rest of the

    network.


    It is expected that good operating procedures on that part of validators

    will completely mitigate these threats.


    ### Practical instructions


    To setup your sentry node architecture you can follow the instructions

    below:


    Validators nodes should edit their `config.toml`:

    ```toml
        # Comma separated list of nodes to keep persistent connections to
        # Do not add private peers to this list if you don't want them advertised
        persistent_peers = [list of sentry nodes]

        # Set true to enable the peer-exchange reactor
        pex = false
    ```


    Sentry Nodes should edit their `config.toml`:

    ```toml
        # Comma separated list of peer IDs to keep private (will not be gossiped to other peers)
        private_peer_ids = "ipaddress of validator nodes"
    ```


    # Delegator FAQ


    ## What is a delegator?

    People that cannot, or do not want to run validator operations, can

    still participate in the staking process as delegators. Indeed,

    validators are not chosen based on their own stake but based on their

    total stake, which is the sum of their own stake and of the stake that

    is delegated to them. This is an important property, as it makes

    delegators a safeguard against validators that exhibit bad behavior. If

    a validator misbehaves, its delegators will move their staked coins away

    from it, thereby reducing its stake. Eventually, if a validator\'s stake

    falls under the top addresses with highest stake, it will exit the

    validator set.


    Delegators share the revenue of their validators, but they also share

    the risks. In terms of revenue, validators and delegators differ in that

    validators can apply a commission on the revenue that goes to their

    delegator before it is distributed. This commission is known to

    delegators beforehand and cannot be changed. In terms of risk,

    delegators\' coins can be slashed if their validator misbehaves. For

    more, see Risks section.


    To become delegators, coin holders need to send a \"Delegate

    transaction\" where they specify how many coins they want to bond and to

    which validator. Later, if a delegator wants to unbond part or all of

    its stake, it needs to send an \"Unbond transaction\". From there, the

    delegator will have to wait 30 days to retrieve its coins.


    ## Directives of delegators

    Being a delegator is not a passive task. Here are the main directives of

    a delegator:

    - Perform careful due diligence on validators before delegating. If a
        validator misbehaves, part of its total stake, which includes the
        stake of its delegators, can be slashed. Delegators should therefore
        carefully select validators they think will behave correctly.
    - Actively monitor their validator after having delegated. Delegators
        should ensure that the validators they\'re delegating to behaves
        correctly, meaning that they have good uptime, do not get hacked and
        participate in governance. If a delegator is not satisfied with its
        validator, it can unbond and switch to another validator.

    ## Revenue

    Validators and delegators earn revenue in exchange for their services. This
    revenue is given in three forms:

    - Block rewards

    - Transaction fees: Each transaction on the Minter Network comes with
        transactions fees. Fees are distributed to validators and delegators
        in proportion to their stake.

    ## Validator commission

    Each validator\'s staking pool receives revenue in proportion to its

    total stake. However, before this revenue is distributed to delegators

    inside the staking pool, the validator can apply a commission. In other

    words, delegators have to pay a commission to their validators on the

    revenue they earn.


    `10%` from reward going to DAO account.


    `10%` from reward going to Developers.


    Lets consider a validator whose stake (i.e. self-bonded stake +

    delegated stake) is 10% of the total stake of all validators. This

    validator has 20% self-bonded stake and applies a commission of 10%. Now

    let us consider a block with the following revenue:

    - 111 Bips as block reward (after subtraction taxes of 20%)

    - 10 Bips as transaction fees (after subtraction taxes of 20%)


    This amounts to a total of 121 Bips to be distributed among all staking

    pools.


    Our validator\'s staking pool represents 10% of the total stake, which

    means the pool obtains 12.1 bips. Now let us look at the internal

    distribution of revenue:

    - Commission = 10% * 80% * 12.1 bips = 0.69696 bips

    - Validator\'s revenue = 20% * 12.1 bips + Commission = 3.11696 bips

    - Delegators\' total revenue = 80% * 12.1 bips - Commission = 8.98304
        bips

    Then, each delegator in the staking pool can claim its portion of the

    delegators\' total revenue.


    ## Risks

    Staking coins is not free of risk. First, staked coins are locked up,

    and retrieving them requires a 30 days waiting period called unbonding

    period. Additionally, if a validator misbehaves, a portion of its total

    stake can be slashed (i.e. destroyed). This includes the stake of their

    delegators.


    There are 2 main slashing conditions:

    - **Double signing**: If someone reports on chain A that a validator
        signed two blocks at the same height on chain A and chain B, this
        validator will get slashed on chain A
    - **Unavailability**: If a validator\'s signature has not been
        included in the last 12 blocks, 1% of stake will get slashed and
        validator will be turned off

    This is why delegators should perform careful due diligence on

    validators before delegating. It is also important that delegators

    actively monitor the activity of their validators. If a validator

    behaves suspiciously or is too often offline, delegators can choose to

    unbond from it or switch to another validator. Delegators can also

    mitigate risk by distributing their stake across multiple validators.
